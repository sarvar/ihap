# **i**ndependent **h**tml5 **a**udio **p**layer
I needed an audioplayer without any annoying dependencies (especially jquery) that supports playing songs via direct streaming (streams from soundcloud for example) and has the ability to control playing videos (from youtube for example). Also i needed the ability to push a playlist to the player. Because i could not find one i wrote this one.
